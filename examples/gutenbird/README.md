# Gutenbird

An OPDS client, on the device.

Project Gutenberg, Standard Ebooks, Open Library, the OPDS conformance
catalogs -- and any other library that speaks the Open Publication
Distribution System, added by its address. Search, browse, and read a book
without leaving the application.

*Captured from a Kobo Clara BW over Wi-Fi with `kobo shot --device`. Those are
real covers, fetched over the reader's own radio and decoded on the device.*

## Why OPDS rather than one website's API

This used to read Gutendex, a JSON front end to Project Gutenberg's own
metadata -- one service, run by one person, answering in a shape nobody else
answers in. OPDS is the shape the rest of the open web answers in: Project
Gutenberg publishes one, and so do Standard Ebooks, Open Library, every
Calibre server and every library running Library Simplified. Speaking OPDS
turns this from an application that reads Gutenberg into an application that
reads libraries, of which Gutenberg is one. See `docs/OPDS.md` for what that
took and what the real catalogs turned out to actually do.

## Why an EPUB is worth the wait

This used to stream Gutenberg's plain text, because a zip archive cannot be
read until its last byte has arrived and the text could be shown from the
first one. `kobo-doc` can read an EPUB now, and an EPUB carries its own
italics, headings and table of contents -- everything the plain text path
threw away in exchange for a first page a few seconds sooner. So an EPUB is
preferred whenever a catalog offers one: fetched in pieces into a shelf blob
with real progress on screen, parsed once whole, and only then handed to the
reader. Plain text remains the fallback. When a catalog offers more than one readable
download, **Choose download** lets you select the format before reading.

## Why the interface never says which version of OPDS answered

There are two incompatible wire formats in the world at once, Atom for 1.2 and
JSON for 2.0, and a reader adding a catalog should never have to know which
one it speaks. `kobo_opds` reads both into one model, and nothing on this
panel is allowed to ask which parser produced it: no badge, no screen that
exists for one version and not the other. The parity tests in
`crates/kobo-opds` and in this application's own test suite exist to keep it
that way.

## Why the reading screen is not built here

Type size, front light, bookmarks and marked passages are not Gutenbird's to
invent. Every
application that shows a book wants the same ones, and a reader who learns them
in one should find them in the next. They live in `kobo-read`.

## Running it

```sh
kobo run --sim --app gutenbird          # in the browser simulator
kobo deploy --device <ip>               # onto a reader over Wi-Fi
```

### Book descriptions

When a catalog embeds a labeled metadata record in its description field,
Gutenbird shows the synopsis under **About** rather than repeating the title,
author and download counters. Edition notices, such as missing illustrations,
remain in their own **Edition** section. Summary provenance is retained, and
ordinary descriptions are unchanged.

![Book description and edition notice](../../docs/quality/evidence/gutenbird-summary/detail-1.png)


The detail header shows the language and the format selected for **Read**,
using the same acquisition choice as the downloader. Common language codes
are expanded; regional/script tags are retained beside the name, and unknown
codes are shown unchanged.

**Choose download** lists the available EPUB and plain-text links, with sample
labels, catalog-provided titles and sizes where supplied. Selecting a link
returns to the book details; **Read** uses that download's offline copy and
saved position. Switching formats does not overwrite the other copy. Downloads
that exceed the device limit, require purchase or are unavailable are excluded.
A catalog response containing multiple editions opens a shelf of choices,
even when all titles match. Image-edition notices appear as **No images** or
**With images**; other editions use the catalog's download title or an edition
number. The full notice remains in the book details. An oversized download is
refused before fetching, with guidance to choose another download or edition.

![Download choices rendered from an original fixture with runtime fonts](../../docs/quality/evidence/gutenbird-formats/download-choices.png)


Entries with the same title remain separate when their language, authors,
publisher or edition date differ. A missing language is not assumed to match
a known language. This keeps distinct catalog choices available rather than
silently opening the first matching title.


When same-title entries differ, shelf captions lead with the language,
publisher or edition date that distinguishes them. Missing metadata is stated
rather than guessed. Ordinary titles keep their author/source caption.

## Missing cover artwork

The shelf uses a title-and-author cover when artwork is missing, too small,
invalid, or still unavailable after the bounded retry limit. Catalog tiles can
use a shared cover from a multi-edition entry without choosing an edition for
the reader; differing covers keep the neutral book icon until an edition is
opened.

## Reading position

Reading positions belong to the selected download URL. Saving updates both the
stored position and the position held for reopening during the same session.
A delayed storage response for a different book or format is ignored, so it
cannot move the book currently being read.


## Offline reopening

After visiting a catalog page, Gutenbird saves a local copy when the response
fits the 256 KiB store limit. If that page cannot be fetched later, the saved
copy keeps its books and navigation accessible. A fresh successful response
always wins over a delayed saved copy. Downloaded books open from the local
shelf at their saved position, including after restarting Cobalt offline.
Unvisited pages and books that have not been downloaded still need a connection.

The simulator check uses an original EPUB and a private local HTTPS fixture:

```sh
python3 scripts/quality/check-gutenbird-offline-sim.py --output /tmp/gutenbird-offline
```

It downloads, turns two pages, stops the process, restarts with networking
disabled and compares the reopened text with the saved page. Default and 170%
text-scale runs passed; physical-reader acceptance remains separate.

## Add a public catalog

Open **Catalogs**, tap **Add a catalog**, then enter the library's HTTPS catalog
address. Choose **Use address**, then **Check connection**. Gutenbird saves the
address only after the response is a valid OPDS catalog, then opens the checked
content without fetching it again. A website page, failed check or cancelled
check does not add a catalog. Adding an address already listed opens the existing
catalog rather than making a duplicate. Public catalog setup does not ask for
account details.

![Shared catalog connection check in the simulator](../../docs/quality/evidence/gutenbird-setup/default/00-ready-to-check.png)

Run the setup, download and offline-reopen fixture journey with:

```sh
python3 scripts/quality/check-gutenbird-offline-sim.py --setup --output /tmp/gutenbird-setup
```

The screenshots use a private local HTTPS fixture, including the illustrated
catalog address; they do not document a live service URL.
