//! The one place in this workspace that talks to the internet.
//!
//! Applications never open a socket. They submit a `Fetch` task, the runtime
//! decides whether the capability was granted, and this module performs the
//! request under a byte ceiling and a deadline. Keeping it in a crate of its
//! own means the other packages stay free of external dependencies, and it
//! means the cryptography can be replaced without any application changing.
//!
//! ## Why the runtime carries its own TLS
//!
//! Measured on a Clara BW: the newest OpenSSL present is 1.0.1j from 2014,
//! there is no CA bundle anywhere on the filesystem, and `s_client` fails with
//! `sslv3 alert handshake failure` against a large share of modern hosts while
//! succeeding against others. A platform whose network calls work for some
//! addresses and silently fail for others is not one anybody can build on, so
//! the runtime links its own verifier and its own roots and ignores the
//! device's libraries entirely.
//!
//! ## Parsing and cryptography
//!
//! URL syntax is parsed by [`http::Uri`], and response heads and chunk sizes
//! by `httparse`, rather than by request-line and header string splitting.
//! The transport remains deliberately small so its byte ceilings, range
//! requests and Kobo-specific TLS roots stay visible, while Rustls uses its
//! maintained ring provider instead of an experimental provider.
